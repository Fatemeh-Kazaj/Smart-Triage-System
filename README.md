Smart Triage System (START Protocol) 
This project is an intelligent triage management tool based on the international START (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) protocol, designed to prioritize casualties in mass casualty incidents (MCI).

Project Purpose
The goal is to assist medical personnel in making fast, data-driven decisions during crises, where time is the most critical factor in saving lives.

 Current Features (v1.0)
Automated Triage Logic: Categorizes patients into four main statuses: Red (Urgent), Yellow (Delayed), Green (Outpatient), and Black (Deceased).

Physiological Inputs: Processes vital data such as respiration rate, severe bleeding status, and mobility.

Statistical Analysis: Calculates the average age of patients and provides a visual distribution of triage statuses to optimize resource management.

 Roadmap (Future Updates)
I plan to enhance this project with the following advanced features:

Smart Priority Scoring: Implementation of a scoring system to prioritize among "Red" status patients based on severity and age.

Survival Probability: Calculating survival chances for optimal allocation of limited ambulance resources.

Pediatric & Geriatric Optimization: Applying priority coefficients for children and the elderly.

 How to Run
To run this project, ensure you have the matplotlib library installed, then execute the main Python file:
